I developped an application enabling users to decide which recipe to cook based on the ingredients available in their fridge or pantry, while taking into account their taste preferences and budget constraints. An Access database called "baseFrigo.mdb" is provided, containing a set of recipes for initial testing and updates throughout the project. The application should cover ingredient management, recipe selection, and maintain code quality, readability, and user-friendly interface design with a focus on usability and originality.
